The Trompeloeil Mock class generator is entirely based on the Google Mock class generator
For more information about Google Mock generator
visit https://github.com/google/googlemock

To use the Trompeloeil Mock class generator, you need to call it
on the command line passing the header file and class for which you want
to generate a Trompeloeil Mock class.

Make sure to install the scripts somewhere in your path.  Then you can
run the program.

  generator.py header-file.h [ClassName]...

If no ClassNames are specified, all classes in the file are emitted.

To change the indentation from the default of 2, set INDENT in
the environment.  For example to use an indent of 4 spaces:

INDENT=4 gmock_gen.py header-file.h ClassName

This version was made from SVN revision 281 in the cppclean repository.

Known Limitations (as listed by the gmock_gen.py function from v1.8)
-----------------
Not all code will be generated properly.  For example, when mocking templated
classes, the template information is lost.  You will need to add the template
information manually.

Not all permutations of using multiple pointers/references will be rendered
properly.  These will also have to be fixed manually.
